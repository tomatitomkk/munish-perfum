This file forces a GitHub Pages rebuild to fix image caching issues.
Timestamp: 2026-02-06 18:47:00 CST

If images are not loading:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check GitHub Actions for deployment status

All images are confirmed to exist in the repository.
The issue is likely CDN propagation delay.
